# **Final Analysis Workflow**

In order to check the similarities between the DNA secuence obtained and to identify the different genes present in the genome, a comparative analysis with similar organisms is made.

To do so, tow main external databases are used:

1. **Blastn**: this database allows us to compare secuence fragments with other organisms, indicating the similarity percentage.
2. **Dfam**: this database allows us to compare secuence fragments with an organism of our choice, giving us a more detailed similarity check.
